                    <p>To bring your ambitions and desires to fulfilment,
                        you must be successful with money. Use the financial
                        principles made clear in the pages that follow. Let
                        them guide you away from the stringency of a lean
                        purse to that fuller, happier life a full purse makes
                        possible.
                        Like the law of gravity, these laws of money are
                        universal and unchanging. May they prove to be for
                        you, as they have proven to so many others, a sure
                        key to a fat purse, larger bank balances and gratifying
                        financial progress</p>

                    <p>Our prosperity as a nation depends upon the personal
                        financial prosperity of each of us as individuals.
                        This book deals with the personal successes of each
                        of us. Success means accomplishments as the result
                        of our own efforts and abilities. Proper preparation
                        is the key to our success. Our acts can be no wiser
                        than our thoughts. Our thinking can be no wiser than
                        our understanding</p>

                    <p>This book of cures for lean purses has been termed
                        a guide to financial understanding. That, indeed, is
                        its purpose: to offer those who are ambitious for financial success an insight which will aid them to
                        acquire money, to keep money and to make their
                        surpluses earn more money.
                        In the pages which follow, we are taken back to
                        Babylon, the cradle in which was nurtured the basic
                        principles of finance now recognized and used, the
                        world over.

                        these tales in such generous quantities to friends, relatives, employees and associates, the author takes
                        this opportunity to express his gratitude. No endorsement could be higher than that of practical men
                        who appreciate its teachings because they, themselves, have worked up to important successes by
                        applying the very principles it advocates.
                        Babylon became the wealthiest city of the ancient
                        world because its citizens were the richest people of
                        their time. They appreciated the value of money.</p>

                    <p>Bansir, the chariot builder of Babylon, was thoroughly discouraged. From his seat upon the low wall
                        surrounding his property, he gazed sadly at his simple
                        home and the open workshop in which stood a
                        partially completed chariot.
                        His wife frequently appeared at the open door. Her
                        furtive glances in his direction reminded him that the
                        meal bag was almost empty and he should be at
                        work finishing the chariot, hammering and hewing,
                        polishing and painting, stretching taut the leather
                        over the wheel rims, preparing it for delivery so he
                        could collect from his wealthy customer</p>
